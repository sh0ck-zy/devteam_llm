# NLP Module

## Introduction
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module is the first point of contact with user input. It processes and understands the intent and context of the queries received from various user interfaces.

## Functionality
- **Intent Recognition**: Determines what the user is asking for, categorizing the query into actionable intents.
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies and extracts relevant entities (names, places, specific terms) from the user's query.
- **Context Management**: Maintains a session-based context to understand the flow of conversation, allowing for more accurate responses to follow-up queries.

## Connections to Other Modules
- Outputs processed query details to the **Data Retrieval Module** for fetching relevant information based on identified intents and entities.
- May send hints or specific processing requirements to the **LLM Adapter Module** to aid in generating context-aware responses.

## Configuration and Customization Options
- **Model Selection**: Allows selection from multiple pre-trained NLP models based on language and specificity of the domain.
- **Training Interface**: Provides options to train or fine-tune models with proprietary data to improve accuracy and relevance in responses.
