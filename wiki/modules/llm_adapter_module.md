# LLM Adapter Module

## Introduction
The LLM Adapter Module interfaces with various Language Learning Models (LLMs) to utilize their capabilities in generating user responses. It facilitates dynamic switching between models to optimize cost and performance.

## Functionality
- **Model Management**: Handles connections to different LLMs, managing their configuration and usage based on the query needs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Formats the retrieved data to be suitable for processing by the chosen LLM.

## Connections to Other Modules
- Receives processed queries and contextual data from the **Data Retrieval Module**.
- Sends refined outputs to the **Generation Module** to construct the final user response.

## Configuration and Customization Options
- **Model Switching**: Configurations to switch between LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3, etc., according to performance evaluations or cost considerations.
- **Preprocessing Rules**: Customizable rules for data formatting that align with the requirements of specific LLMs.
