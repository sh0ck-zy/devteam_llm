# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of the architecture of the Modular Chatbot Framework. Designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, the framework is composed of several key modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the chatbot's functionality.

## System Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the system:

### Components

1. **API Gateway**: Central hub for managing and routing all incoming and outgoing requests.
2. **Chatbot Engine**: Core of the application, consisting of several modules:
   - NLP Module
   - Data Retrieval Module
   - LLM Adapter Module
   - Generation Module

For more detailed information about each module, please refer to the [Module Descriptions](#module-descriptions).

## Data Flow

The data flow through the system is as follows:

1. **User Interface** sends a query to the **API Gateway**.
2. **API Gateway** routes the query to the **NLP Module** for processing.
3. **NLP Module** parses the query and sends the results to the **Data Retrieval Module**.
4. **Data Retrieval Module** fetches necessary data and passes it along to the **LLM Adapter Module**.
5. **LLM Adapter Module** processes the data with the appropriate LLM and sends the results to the **Generation Module**.
6. **Generation Module** generates the final user response and sends it back through the **API Gateway** to the **User Interface**.

## Modularity and Flexibility

Each component in the system is designed as a modular unit, allowing for easy updates, maintenance, and scalability. This design supports the integration of additional data sources, LLMs, or changes in deployment environments without major overhauls of the system.
