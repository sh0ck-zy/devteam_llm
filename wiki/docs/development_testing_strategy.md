# Development and Testing Strategy

## Development Approach

- **Isolated Development**: Modules are developed and tested in isolation to ensure they meet their specific requirements.
- **Integration Testing**: Conducted to ensure modules work together seamlessly.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Each module undergoes rigorous unit testing.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulates real-world usage to ensure the system as a whole functions correctly.
